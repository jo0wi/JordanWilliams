# Floating Point Adder

## Overview
    this file adds two given IEEE-754 floating point numbers together and stores them back as an IEEE-754 floating point number using only integer math supported by the class ISA

    to make sure every possible condition is checked the program is set up to loop 6 times with 6 different sets of numbers though this value can be edited and the numbers in memeory can be changed

## How to run
    just run the program provided alonside the assembly is the emulator output of the code to compare the output from your computer in the test bench.
    if you wanted to run this program for fun outside of just testing then you can change the values at the top of the code to different numbers as well as change the number of loops.
